        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-right: 1rem; margin-left: 1.2rem;">Formula One (also known as Formula 1 or F1) is the highest class of international racing for open-wheel single-seater formula racing 
            cars sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). 
            The World Drivers' Championship, which became the FIA Formula One World Championship in 1981, has been one of the premier forms of 
            racing around the world since its inaugural season in 1950. The word formula in the name refers to the set of rules to which all 
            participants' cars must conform. A Formula One season consists of a series of races, known as Grands Prix, which take place worldwide
            on both purpose-built circuits and closed public roads.<br /><br />
            A points system is used at Grands Prix to determine two annual World Championships: one for drivers, the other for constructors. 
            Each driver must hold a valid Super Licence, the highest class of racing licence issued by the FIA. 
            The races must run on tracks graded "1" (formerly "A"), the highest grade-rating issued by the FIA.<br /><br />
            Formula One cars are the fastest regulated road-course racing cars in the world, owing to very high cornering speeds achieved through 
            the generation of large amounts of aerodynamic downforce. Much of this downforce is generated by front and rear wings, which have the 
            side effect of causing severe turbulence behind each car. The turbulence reduces the downforce generated by a car following directly 
            behind, making it hard to overtake. Major changes to the cars for the 2022 season has seen greater use of ground effect aerodynamics, 
            and modified wings to reduce the turbulence behind the cars, with the goal of making overtaking easier.The cars are dependent on 
            electronics and aerodynamics, suspension and tyres. Traction control, launch control, and automatic shifting, plus other electronic 
            driving aids, were first banned in 1994. They were briefly reintroduced in 2001, and have more recently been banned since 2004 and 
            2008, respectively.

            <p style="text-align: justify; margin-right: 1rem; margin-left: 1.2rem;">
                The Formula One series originated with the European Championship of Grand Prix motor racing of the 1920s and 1930s. The formula 
                consists of a set of rules that all participants' cars must meet. Formula One was a new formula agreed upon during 1946 with the
                first non-championship races taking place that year. The first Formula 1 race was the 1946 Turin Grand Prix. A number of Grand 
                Prix racing organisations had laid out rules for a world championship before World War II, but due to the suspension of racing 
                during the conflict, the World Drivers' Championship did not become formalised until 1947. The first world championship race took
                place at Silverstone in the United Kingdom in 1950. Giuseppe Farina, in his Alfa Romeo, won the first World Championship for 
                Drivers in 1950, narrowly defeating his teammate Juan Manuel Fangio. However, Fangio won the title in 1951, 1954, 1955, 1956, 
                and 1957 (his record of five World Championship titles stood for 45 years until Michael Schumacher took his sixth title in 2003).
                Fangio's streak was interrupted (after an injury) by two-time champion Alberto Ascari of Ferrari. <br /><br />
                A championship for constructors followed in 1958. Although the UK's Stirling Moss was able to compete regularly, he was never 
                able to win the world championship and has been described by The Independent as "The greatest driver to never win the world 
                championship".In a seven-year span between 1955 and 1961, Moss finished as championship runner-up four times and in third 
                place the other three times. Fangio, however, achieved the record of winning 24 of the 52 races he entered a record that 
                holds to this day. National championships existed in South Africa and the UK in the 1960s and 1970s. Non-championship Formula 
                One events were held by promoters for many years. However, due to the increasing cost of competition, the last of these occurred 
                in 1983.<br /><br />
                This period featured teams managed by road-car manufacturers Alfa Romeo, Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz, and Maserati. The first seasons 
                featured pre-war cars like Alfa's 158. They were front-engined, with narrow tyres and 1.5-litre supercharged or 4.5-litre 
                naturally aspirated engines. The 1952 and 1953 World Championships were run to Formula Two regulations, for smaller, less powerful 
                cars, due to concerns over the lack of Formula One cars available. When a new Formula One formula for engines limited to 
                2.5 litres was reinstated to the world championship for 1954, Mercedes-Benz introduced the advanced W196. This featured innovations
                such as desmodromic valves and fuel injection, as well as enclosed streamlined bodywork. Mercedes drivers won the championship 
                for two years, before the team withdrew from all motorsport in the wake of the 1955 Le Mans disaster. &nbsp; <a href="#top">Go to the Top</a>

            <h1>The Race</h1>
                <p>
                    A Formula One Grand Prix event spans a weekend. It begins with two free practice sessions on Friday, and one free practice on 
                    Saturday. Additional drivers (commonly known as third drivers) are allowed to run on Fridays, but only two cars may be used per 
                    team, requiring a race driver to give up their seat. A qualifying session is held after the last free practice session. 
                    This session determines the starting order for the race on Sunday.
                </p>
            <h2>The Tyres(Rules)</h2>
                <p>
                    Each driver may use no more than thirteen sets of dry-weather tyres, four sets of intermediate tyres, and 
                    three sets of wet-weather tyres during a race weekend. &nbsp;<a href="./tyres.html">For More Information. Click Here</a>
                </p>
            <h2>Qualifying</h2>
                <p>
                    For much of the sport's history, qualifying sessions differed little from practice sessions; drivers would have one or more 
                    sessions in which to set their fastest time, with the grid order determined by each driver's best single lap, with the fastest 
                    getting first place on the grid, referred to as pole position. From 1996 to 2002, the format was a one-hour shootout. This 
                    approach lasted until the end of 2002 before the rules were changed again because the teams were not running in the early 
                    part of the session to take advantage of better track conditions later on.<br />
                    Grids were generally limited to 26 cars, if the race had more entries, qualification would also decide which drivers 
                    would start the race. During the early 1990s, the number of entries was so high that the worst-performing teams had to enter a 
                    pre-qualifying session, with the fastest cars allowed through to the main qualifying session. The qualifying format began to change 
                    in the early 2000s, with the FIA experimenting with limiting the number of laps, determining the aggregate time over two sessions,
                    and allowing each driver only one qualifying lap. &nbsp; <a href="#top">Go to the Top</a>
                    <br />
                </p>
                <h3>Current Qualifying</h3>
                <p>
                    The current qualifying system was adopted in the 2006 season. Known as "knock-out" qualifying, it is split into three periods,
                    known as Q1, Q2, and Q3. In each period, drivers run qualifying laps to attempt to advance to the next period, with the 
                    slowest drivers being "knocked out" of qualification (but not necessarily the race) at the end of the period and their grid 
                    positions set within the rearmost five based on their best lap times. Drivers are allowed as many laps as they wish within 
                    each period. After each period, all times are reset, and only a driver's fastest lap in that period (barring infractions) 
                    counts. Any timed lap started before the end of that period may be completed, and will count toward that driver's placement. 
                    The number of cars eliminated in each period is dependent on the total number of cars entered into the championship.
                    Currently, with 20 cars, Q1 runs for 18 minutes, and eliminates the slowest five drivers. During this period, any driver 
                    whose best lap takes longer than 107% of the fastest time in Q1 will not be allowed to start the race without permission 
                    from the stewards. Otherwise, all drivers proceed to the race albeit in the worst starting positions. This rule does not 
                    affect drivers in Q2 or Q3. In Q2, the 15 remaining drivers have 15 minutes to set one of the ten fastest times and proceed 
                    to the next period. Finally, Q3 lasts 12 minutes and sees the remaining ten drivers decide the first ten grid positions.<br />
                    
                    Each car is allocated one set of the softest tyres for use in Q3. The cars that qualify for Q3 must return them after Q3;
                    the cars that do not qualify for Q3 can use them during the race. As of 2022, all drivers are given a free choice of 
                    tyre to use at the start of the Grand Prix, whereas in previous years only the drivers that did not participate in Q3
                    had free tyre choice for the start of the race. Any penalties that affect grid position are applied at the end of qualifying.
                    Grid penalties can be applied for driving infractions in the previous or current Grand Prix, or for changing a gearbox or 
                    engine component. If a car fails scrutineering, the driver will be excluded from qualifying but will be allowed to start 
                    the race from the back of the grid at the race steward's discretion. &nbsp; <a href="#top">Go to the Top</a>
                </p>
            <h2>RACE</h2>
                <p>
                    The race begins with a warm-up lap, after which the cars assemble on the starting grid in the order they qualified. 
                    This lap is often referred to as the formation lap, as the cars lap in formation with no overtaking (although a driver who 
                    makes a mistake may regain lost ground). The warm-up lap allows drivers to check the condition of the track and their car, 
                    gives the tyres a chance to warm up to increase traction and grip, and also gives the pit crews time to clear themselves and 
                    their equipment from the grid for the race start. <br /><br />
                    Once all the cars have formed on the grid, after the medical car positions itself behind the pack, a light system above the 
                    track indicates the start of the race: five red lights are illuminated at intervals of one second; they are all then 
                    extinguished simultaneously after an unspecified time (typically less than 3 seconds) to signal the start of the race. 
                    The start procedure may be abandoned if a driver stalls on the grid or on the track in an unsafe position, signalled by 
                    raising their arm. If this happens, the procedure restarts: a new formation lap begins with the offending car removed from 
                    the grid. The race may also be restarted in the event of a serious accident or dangerous conditions, with the original start 
                    voided. The race may be started from behind the Safety Car if race control feels a racing start would be excessively 
                    dangerous, such as extremely heavy rainfall. As of the 2019 season, there will always be a standing restart. If due to
                    heavy rainfall a start behind the safety car is necessary, then after the track has dried sufficiently, drivers will 
                    form up for a standing start. There is no formation lap when races start behind the Safety Car.
                    <br /><br />
                    Under normal circumstances, the winner of the race is the first driver to cross the finish line having completed a set number 
                    of laps. Race officials may end the race early (putting out a red flag) due to unsafe conditions such as extreme rainfall, 
                    and it must finish within two hours, although races are only likely to last this long in the case of extreme weather or if the
                    safety car is deployed during the race. When a situation justifies pausing the race without terminating it, the red flag is 
                    deployed; since 2005, a ten-minute warning is given before the race is resumed behind the safety car, which leads the field
                    for a lap before it returns to the pit lane (before then the race resumed in race order from the penultimate lap before the 
                    red flag was shown).
                    <br /><br />
                    In the 1950s, race distances varied from 300 km (190 mi) to 600 km (370 mi). The maximum race length was reduced to 
                    400 km (250 mi) in 1966 and 325 km (202 mi) in 1971. The race length was standardised to the current 305 km (190 mi) in 
                    1989. However, street races like Monaco have shorter distances, to keep under the two-hour limit.
                    <br /><br />
                    Drivers may overtake one another for position over the course of the race. If a leader comes across a backmarker (slower car)
                    who has completed fewer laps, the back marker is shown a blue flag telling them that they are obliged to allow the leader 
                    to overtake them. The slower car is said to be "lapped" and, once the leader finishes the race, is classified as finishing 
                    the race "one lap down". A driver can be lapped numerous times, by any car in front of them. A driver who fails to complete
                    more than 90% of the race distance is shown as "not classified" in the results.
                    <br /><br />
                    Throughout the race, drivers may make pit stops to change tyres and repair damage. Different teams and drivers employ 
                    different pit stop strategies in order to maximise their car's potential. Three dry tyre compounds, with different durability 
                    and adhesion characteristics, are available to drivers. Over the course of a race, drivers must use two of the three 
                    available compounds. The different compounds have different levels of performance and choosing when to use which compound is 
                    a key tactical decision to make. Different tyres have different colours on their sidewalls; this allows spectators to 
                    understand the strategies. Under wet conditions, drivers may switch to one of two specialised wet weather tyres with 
                    additional grooves (one "intermediate", for mild wet conditions, such as after recent rain, one "full wet", for racing in or
                    immediately after rain). A driver must make at least one stop to use two tyre compounds; up to three stops are typically 
                    made, although further stops may be necessary to fix damage or if weather conditions change. If rain tyres are used, 
                    drivers are no longer obliged to use both types of dry tyres. &nbsp; <a href="#top">Go to the Top</a>
