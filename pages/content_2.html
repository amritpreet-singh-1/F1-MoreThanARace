            Used during an incident on circuit. Shown in conjunction with a yellow flag to indicate that the Safety Car is 
            on track. Full course yellow flag applies. Drivers must hold position and slow down. It's also called Full Safety Car.

    <h3>VSC Board</h3>
        <p>
            Used during an incident (car spins and goes off the track, when 2 or more cars make contact but still all of them can drive, etc.) 
            on circuit.Shown in conjunction with a yellow flag to indicate that the virtual safety car is in use. During this time, the drivers 
            are given minimum sector times that they must stay above. Full course double yellow flag applies. The car's time relative to this set 
            is measured at each marshalling post (approximately every 50 m), and the difference is referred to as the car's "delta" time. This 
            delta time is reported to the driver, and must remain positive throughout the VSC period else the driver will be penalised

            green flag is shown at all stations for the lap following the end of a full-course yellow (or safety car). A green flag is also shown at
            the start of a session.

            should be prepared to stop.

    <h2>Point System</h2>
          <p>
            Various systems for awarding championship points have been used since 1950. The current system, in place since 2010, awards the top 
            ten cars points in the Drivers' and Constructors' Championships, with the winner receiving 25 points. All points won at each race are 
            added up, and the driver and constructor with the most points at the end of the season are crowned World Champions. Regardless of 
            whether a driver stays with the same team throughout the season, or switches teams, all points earned by them count for the Drivers' 
            Championship. <br><br>
            A driver must be classified in order to receive points, as of 2022, a driver must complete at least 90% of the race distance in order 
            to receive points. Therefore, it is possible for a driver to receive points even if they retired before the end of the race.<br><br>
            From some time between the 1977 and 1980 to the end of 2021 if less than 75% of the race laps were completed by the winner, then only 
            half of the points listed in the table were awarded to the drivers and constructors. This has happened on only five occasions in the 
            history of the championship, and it had a notable influence on the final standing of the 1984 season. The last occurrence was at the 
            2021 Belgian Grand Prix when the race was called off after just 3 laps behind a safety car due to torrential rain. The half 
            points rules was replaced by distance dependent gradual scale system for 2022.

          </p>

    <h2>Grand Prix</h2>
    <p>
        The number of Grands Prix held in a season has varied over the years. The inaugural 1950 world championship season comprised only seven 
        races, while the 2019 season contained 21 races. There were no more than 11 Grands Prix per season during the early decades of the 
        championship, although a large number of non-championship Formula One events also took place. The number of Grands Prix increased to an 
        average of 16 to 17 by the late 1970s, while non-championship events ended in 1983. More Grands Prix began to be held in the 2000s, and 
        recent seasons have seen an average of 19 races. In 2021 and 2022, the calendar peaked at 22 events, the highest number of world 
        championship races in one season.<br><br>
        Six of the original seven races took place in Europe; the only non-European race that counted towards the World Championship in 1950 was 
        the Indianapolis 500, which was held to different regulations and later replaced by the United States Grand Prix. The F1 championship 
        gradually expanded to other non-European countries. Argentina hosted the first South American Grand Prix in 1953, and Morocco hosted the 
        first African World Championship race in 1958. Asia and Oceania followed (Japan in 1976 and Australia in 1985), and the first race in the 
        Middle East was held in 2004. The 19 races of the 2014 season were spread over every populated continent except for Africa, with 10 Grands
        Prix held outside Europe.<br><br>
        Some of the Grands Prix pre-date the formation of the World Championship, such as the French Grand Prix, and were incorporated into the 
        championship as Formula One races in 1950. The British and Italian Grands Prix are the only events to have been held every Formula One 
        season; other long-running races include the Belgian, German, and French Grands Prix. The Monaco Grand Prix was first held in 1929 and 
        has run continuously since 1955 (with the exception of 2020), and is widely considered to be one of the most important and prestigious 
        automobile races in the world.<br><br>
        All Grands Prix have traditionally been run during the day, until the inaugural Singapore Grand Prix hosted the first Formula One night 
        race in 2008,[104] which was followed by the day-night Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in 2009 and the Bahrain Grand Prix which converted to a night
         race in 2014. Other Grands Prix in Asia have had their start times adjusted to benefit the European television audience.
